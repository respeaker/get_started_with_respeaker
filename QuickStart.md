#Quick Start

##Setup Wi-Fi

ReSpeaker is set to Repeater Mode as default, and you have to connect it to an existing wireless network before enjoying the speech recognition with the Internet.

When you first power on ReSpeaker, it will create a Wi-Fi network called "ReSpeakerXXXXXX". Here "XXXXXX" is the last 6 of your ReSpeaker MAC address, which is marked on the board. Connect your computer to this network. 

<div class="text-center">

</div>



**If "ReSpeakerXXXXXX" does not appear, but "LinkIt_Smart_7688_XXXXXX" is found. Please click [here](QuickStart.md#update-for-old-version).**

Once you've obtained an IP address, open a web browser, and enter `192.168.100.1` in the address bar. After a few seconds, a web page will appear asking for ssid and password of an existing Wi-Fi network.

<div class="text-center">
<img src="https://github.com/respeaker/get_started_with_respeaker/blob/master/img/wifi2.png?raw=true" width="50%" height="50%">
</div>

Select the Wi-Fi you wish to connect to and enter the password. When you press the `OK` button, ReSpeaker will join the specified network.

    while True:                             
        try:                                
            time.sleep(1)                           
        except KeyboardInterrupt:

if __name__ == '__main__':       
    main()                  
```
Try to say "ReSpeaker, play music!". Then ReSpeaker will play "Tchaikovsky\_Concerto\_No.1p.mp3" in the current path with **madplay**.

	<img src="https://github.com/respeaker/get_started_with_respeaker/blob/master/img/dlna.png?raw=true" width="50%" height="50%">
	</div>

4. Connect your headphone/speaker to respeaker, then you can enjoy the music now. 
 


##Use SD Card to Extend Storage
More often than not, a limited amount of storage is available on embedded devices(ReSpeaker has only 5M on-board flash storage left for users). More storage for applications and data can expand ReSpeaker's potential, so use SD card to extend storage as an **extroot** is a good choice.

By employing **extroot**, expansion of the storage capacity of your root file system is accomplished by using an added storage device. 
During the boot process, external storage space is mounted as the root file system, or in an overlay configuration over the original file system. 

1. Make sure your SD card is plugged into ReSpeaker and `/dev/mmcblk0p1` can be detected by `df -h` or `ls /dev`.

	```
	root@ReSpeaker:/# df -h
	Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
	rootfs                    1.8M    832.0K    960.0K  46% /
	/dev/root                29.0M     29.0M         0 100% /rom
	tmpfs                    61.7M    276.0K     61.5M   0% /tmp
	/dev/mtdblock6            1.8M    832.0K    960.0K  46% /overlay
	overlayfs:/overlay        1.8M    832.0K    960.0K  46% /
	tmpfs                   512.0K         0    512.0K   0% /dev
	/dev/mmcblk0p1            7.4G      2.5M      7.4G   0% /tmp/run/mountd/mmcblk0p1
	```

2. Format your SD card into two partitions, one is FAT32, the other is EXT4. EXT4 file system will be as an extroot while FAT32 will be as a normal storage device, which is able to transfer files between ReSpeaker and your PC.

	```
	umount /dev/mmcblk0p1
	fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
	# ------------------ fdisk ------------------------
	>Command (m for help):o
	>Created a new DOS disklabel
	>Command (m for help):n

	e   extended (container for logical partitions)
	>Select (default p):p

	>Command (m for help):w
	>The partition table has been altered.
	>Calling i[  292.010000]  mmcblk0: p1 p2
	>octl() to re-read partition table.
	>Syncing disks.
	# ------------------ end ------------------------
	
	mkfs.fat /dev/mmcblk0p1
	mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2
	
	# reload mtk_sd kernel module
	rmmod mtk_sd
	insmod mtk_sd
	```

3. Prepare your external storage root overlay.
	
	```
	mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt ; tar -C /overlay -cvf - . | tar -C /mnt -xf - ; umount /mnt
	```

4. Create fstab with the following command. This command will create a fstab template enabling all partitions and setting '/mnt/mmcblk0p2' partition as '/overlay' partition.
	
	```
	block detect > /etc/config/fstab;
	sed -i s/option$'\t'enabled$'\t'\'0\'/option$'\t'enabled$'\t'\'1\'/ /etc/config/fstab;
	sed -i s#/mnt/mmcblk0p2#/overlay# /etc/config/fstab;
	cat /etc/config/fstab;
   	```
   
5. Check if it is mountable to overlay.

	```
	root@mylinkit:/# mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /overlay/
	root@ReSpeaker:/# df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs                    1.8M    832.0K    960.0K  46% /
/dev/root                29.0M     29.0M         0 100% /rom

tmpfs                   512.0K         0    512.0K   0% /dev
/dev/mmcblk0p2            5.2G     11.8M      4.9G   0% /tmp/run/mountd/mmcblk0p2
/dev/mmcblk0p1            2.0G      4.0K      2.0G   0% /tmp/run/mountd/mmcblk0p1
/dev/mmcblk0p2            5.2G     11.8M      4.9G   0% /overlay 
	```

6. Reboot ReSpeaker and check again. If SD card is mounted automatically, you are done. More informations about **extroot**, please click [here](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot).

##Install software on ReSpeaker

After extending storage with a SD card, there are enough storage to install software on ReSpeaker.

1. Install git

	```
	opkg update
	opkg install git git-http
	```
